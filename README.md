# What's in this repo?
Here you'll find _batch_ scripts which I wrote for fun, learning purposes, or personal needs.

**A few things to consider**
- Unless stated otherwise, the texts and UI are in polish.
- Scripts are provided in 'as-is' state - no modifications had been made. Clunkiness, messy coding style and maybe even bugs are to be expected.
- Every batch is in script form, even if it was originally packaged in exe binary.
- I can't guarantee that they'll run properly on modern operating systems. One of the scripts was written on PC running Windows XP.
- Every website the script is pointing to is closed. Probably permanently.
- This stuff is not licensed in any ways, full FOSS, even if the script itself is stating otherwise.

This one goes far back to 2012, my first *bigger*, publicly avaliable project. 14-year old me tought it'd be cool to integrate a bunch of useful commandline tools into one script. I also used this as an opportunity to learn batch scripting in general. First version was written on Windows XP PC.

Firstly published on (now closed) polish forum, focused on retro operating systems (DOS, 3.11, 9x), scripting and programming.

Originally lost due to system failure and lack of backups (Remember to do yours).

Huge shoutout to **kotsai**, the admin of previously mentioned forum, who recovered the original binary from his own forum backup and sent me the files immediately after I've decided to contact him via e-mail about it. 10 years after I lost the files.

It's the newest published version.
